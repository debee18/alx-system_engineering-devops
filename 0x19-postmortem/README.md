Postmortem: Web Service Outage - September 14, 2023

Summary:

Duration:
Start: September 14, 2023, 11:30 AM WAT (West Africa Time)
End: September 14, 2023, 12:45 PM WAT
Impact:
Approximately 30% of our users experienced slow response times and errors during the outage.
Root Cause:
The outage was attributed to an unexpected surge in database connections that overwhelmed the database server.
Timeline:

11:30 AM WAT: Issue was initially detected as monitoring alerts indicated a significant increase in response latency and error rates.
11:35 AM WAT: The engineering team promptly commenced investigations into the issue.
11:40 AM WAT: Initial suspicion centered around a recent code deployment, but deployment logs showed no irregularities.
11:50 AM WAT: Attention shifted to the database, and logs revealed an unprecedented spike in connection attempts.
12:00 PM WAT: The possibility of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack was considered, but traffic analysis did not align with typical attack patterns.
12:15 PM WAT: It was determined that the problem stemmed from a surge in legitimate user traffic, not a malicious attack.
12:30 PM WAT: The incident was escalated to the database administration team, who swiftly addressed the database connection overload.
12:45 PM WAT: The issue was successfully resolved through optimization of database connection pooling settings.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was identified as an abrupt and substantial increase in database connection attempts, primarily due to higher-than-anticipated user traffic. This surge overwhelmed the database server's capacity to handle incoming connections.

To resolve the issue, the following corrective action was taken:

Database Connection Pooling Optimization: We reconfigured the database connection pooling settings to efficiently manage and recycle connections, thus preventing the database from becoming overburdened during peak traffic periods.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

In light of this incident, we are implementing the following measures:

Capacity Planning: A comprehensive analysis of traffic patterns will be conducted to better anticipate and prepare for surges in user activity, leading to the expansion of our infrastructure.
Enhanced Monitoring: We will deploy more robust monitoring and alerting systems to promptly identify abnormal traffic patterns and database connection issues in real-time.
Auto-Scaling: The exploration of auto-scaling capabilities for both web and database servers to dynamically adjust resources based on fluctuating traffic demands.
User Communication: Improved communication strategies will be implemented to keep users informed during outages, thereby mitigating user frustration.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

A thorough review of our database architecture, with considerations for sharding or replication to enhance scalability.
Implementation of a failover mechanism to redirect traffic to standby databases during peak loads.
Deployment of additional database monitoring solutions to detect connection-related issues at an earlier stage.
Documentation of incident response procedures to ensure a more structured approach during future outages.
In conclusion, the recent outage, though unfortunate, has provided valuable insights into enhancing our system's resilience. We have not only identified the root cause and implemented immediate solutions but also outlined a comprehensive plan for long-term improvements to prevent similar incidents. We deeply appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to elevate the reliability of our services.
