The following sections explain the physical keyboard actions
and the OS interrupts. When you press the key "g" the browser receives the
event and the auto-complete functions kick in.
Depending on your browser's algorithm and if you are in
private/incognito mode or not various suggestions will be presented
to you in the dropdown below the URL bar. Most of these algorithms sort
and prioritize results based on search history, bookmarks, cookies, and
popular searches from the internet as a whole. As you are typing
"google.com" many blocks of code run and the suggestions will be refined
with each keypress. It may even suggest "google.com" before you finish typing
it.Sorting and Prioritization: The autocomplete algorithm sorts and prioritizes the suggestions based on multiple criteria.

the recency of visits, and the relevance to the entered text.
